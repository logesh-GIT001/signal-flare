## 🚧 Project Status: Initial Development

SIGNAL-FLARE is currently under active development. Check back soon for the first release!

## What is SIGNAL-FLARE?

A lightweight deception engine that provides **zero-false-positive breach confirmation** by instrumenting your application with honey-credentials. When an attacker accesses these credentials, you get instant alerts.

### Why SIGNAL-FLARE?

- ✅ **Zero false positives** - Legitimate users never touch honey-credentials
- ✅ **Instant ground truth** - Know immediately when credentials are stolen
- ✅ **Forces attacker uncertainty** - Every credential becomes suspect
- ✅ **Integrates with existing tools** - Enriches your SIEM/EDR alerts

## Coming Soon

- [x] Project structure
- [ ] CLI tool for generating honey-credentials
- [ ] Stateless listener service
- [ ] Docker Compose deployment
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Complete documentation
